Overview

This course focuses on the essential skill of prompt engineering, which involves crafting precise and effective input prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT and Claude in producing accurate and relevant outputs. In the context of Business Intelligence, prompt engineering enables users to translate business questions into well-structured queries that yield meaningful AI responses.
